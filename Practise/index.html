          Tottenham staged a stunning comeback to win at Arsenal for the first
          time in 17 years and wreck the Gunners' hopes of going top of the
          Premier League.
        </p>
        <p class="report">
          Arsenal were on course to leapfrog Chelsea, if only briefly, as they
          cruised into a two-goal lead at the interval courtesy of goals from
          Samir Nasri and Marouane Chamakh. Spurs, after being comprehensively
          outplayed, then embarked on an unlikely revival that not only saw them
          wipe out Arsenal's comfortable advantage but go on to take all three
          points.
        </p>
        <p class="report">
          Gareth Bale started the recovery with a fine finish five minutes after
          the break, before Rafael van der Vaart levelled from the spot after
          Cesc Fabregas inexplicably handled his free-kick.
        </p>
        <p class="report">
          And with only five minutes left Younes Kaboul reduced the vast
          majority of The Emirates gallery to silence when he headed Van der
          Vaart's free-kick low past Lukasz Fabianski.
